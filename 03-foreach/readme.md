## forEach

Create a function `forEach` which executes a provided function once for each array element, taking 2 arguments:
  - the array
  - the **callback** function to execute for each element, taking 1 argument:
    - the value of the current element being processed in the array

> (Obviously) you are not allowed to use `Array.forEach`
